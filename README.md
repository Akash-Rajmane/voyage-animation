### About:
This is a simple animation that includes a bird, a ship and a nice-looking background. The background consists of the sky with bright shining sun and deep blue sea. The bird flies in the sky. The ship is operated on the click of the button. Also on the click of button the pirates of the caribbean ringtone plays.

### Technical Stacks Used :
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

### How I Made It?
I created two buttons named start and stop which starts,moves and stops the ship. The bird repeatedly flies from left to right. For both the bird and ship, I have used setInterval function for repeatitions. I have used audio tag to insert the pirates of the caribbean ringtone. The ringtone plays when you click on start and pause when you click on stop. The glowing sun is created by using box-shadow , keyframes and animation commands.
