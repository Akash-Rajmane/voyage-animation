### About:
This is a simple animation which includes a bird, a ship and a nice looking background. The background consists of sky with bright shining sun and deep blue sea. The bird flys in the sky. The ship is operated on the click of the button. Also on the click of button the pirates of the caribbean ringtone plays.

### Technical Stacks Used :
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

### How I Made It?
I created two buttons named start and stop which starts,moves and stops the ship. The bird repeatedly flys from right to left. For both the bird and ship, I have used setInterval function for repeatations. I have used audio tag to insert the pirates of the caribbean ringtone. The ringtone plays when you click on start and pause when you click on stop. The glowing sun is created by using box-shadow , keyframes and animation commands.
